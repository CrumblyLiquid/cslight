# CSLight

Simple Python script that controls your Philips Hue Lights based on your health in CS:GO (or other games)
It achieves that by capturing a specified area of your screen and reading the health value with `tesseract` OCR. It then calls the Philips Hue API to change the brigtness of your lights.
